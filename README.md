Checkers Robot
============

This is the source code (and assisting files) of the Wilmington Christian School Class of 2014's senior computer science project. The project is a robot built from Legos and the Lego Mindstorms NXT robotics kit. 

At the time of completion, the robot was able to play a game of checkers against a person (or itself). The only interaction with the robot required by the person was to press a button on the robot to signal completion of the player's turn. The robot is fully capable of efficiently scanning the board via light sensor to determine the player's move, calculating the best possible move based upon [minimax game theory](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minimax) calculating 8-10 moves ahead, moving it's own pieces, and removing 'captured' pieces from the board. At the time of writing, the robot has not been defeated by a human opponent.
