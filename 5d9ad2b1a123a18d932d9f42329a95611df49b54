Player.getAllMoves generates the moves list for the current board owned by the player, which means that the list stays the same when recursing through multiple moves, because the player's board is not changed until the best move is actually determined.  The best way to fix this would be to add the board as an argument, but Corbin is not going to like that because he is going to think that gives the method more of a static behavior.
